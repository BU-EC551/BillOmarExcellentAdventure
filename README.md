All the files on here so far are for Lab 3. 

The files under the Lab 3 branch can be brought right into the ISE Design Tools and opened and run. 

The files under "New COE/GIF/Reference Images" are simply reference images that are good to have available. 

This is a project for our EC551 class. 

This project is produced by Omar Rana and Bill Vangos.
