The files under the Lab 3 branch can be brought right into the ISE Design Tools and opened and run. 

The files under "New COE/GIF/Reference Images" are simply reference images that are good to have available. 

Go to the Final Project folder to find the most up to date files. 

Read the powerpoint for a good overview of the project, or watch our final video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ivCkx2UhB4

This is a project for our EC551 class. 

This project is produced by Omar Rana and Bill Vangos.
